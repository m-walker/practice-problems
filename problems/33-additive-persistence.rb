# Using the Ruby language, have the function AdditivePersistence(num) take the num parameter being passed which will always 
# be a positive integer and return its additive persistence which is the number of times you must add the digits in num until 
# ou reach a single digit. For example: if num is 2718 then your program should return 2 because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 
# 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9. 

# Input:4
# Output:0

# Input:19
# Output:2

def AdditivePersistence(num)

  # code goes here
  return num 
         
end
