# Using the Ruby language, have the function SecondGreatLow(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the second
# lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively, separated by a space. For example: if arr contains [7, 7, 12, 98, 106] the 
# utput should be 12 98. The array will not be empty and will contain at least 2 numbers. It can get tricky if there's just two
#  numbers! 

# Input:1, 42, 42, 180
# Output:"42 42"

# Input:4, 90
# Output:"90 4"

def SecondGreatLow(arr)

  # code goes here
  return arr
