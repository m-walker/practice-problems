# Using the Ruby language, have the function HammingDistance(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will 
# only contain two strings of equal length and return the Hamming distance between them. The Hamming distance is the number 
# of positions where the corresponding characters are different. For example: if strArr is ["coder", "codec"] then your program 
# should return 1. The string will always be of equal length and will only contain lowercase characters from the alphabet and 
# numbers. 

# Input:"10011", "10100"
# Output:3

# Input:"helloworld", "worldhello"
# Output:8


def HammingDistance(strArr)

  # code goes here
  return strArr
