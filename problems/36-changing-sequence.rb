# Using the Ruby language, have the function ChangingSequence(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the 
# index at which the numbers stop increasing and begin decreasing or stop decreasing and begin increasing. For example: if 
#   arr is [1, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, 1] then your program should return 3 because 6 is the last point in the array where the numbers 
#   were increasing and the next number begins a decreasing sequence. The array will contain at least 3 numbers and it may 
#   contains only a single sequence, increasing or decreasing. If there is only a single sequence in the array, then your 
#   program should return -1. Indexing should begin with 0. 


# Input:-4, -2, 9, 10
# Output:-1

# Input:5, 4, 3, 2, 10, 11
# Output:3
